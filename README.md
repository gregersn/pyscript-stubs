# PyScript Stubs

Because there is no `pyscript` package to install in the Python environment
used by your IDE, there are no type hints for the IDE to use for code
analysis while coding a PyScript project.

This project contains [stub files](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/distributing.html#stub-files)
for PyScript and related projects (for example, MicroPython).

It is a work in progress.
